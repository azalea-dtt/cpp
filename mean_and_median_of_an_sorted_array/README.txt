Given n size unsorted array, find its mean and median.
Mean of an array = (sum of all elements) / (number of elements)
Median of a sorted array of size n is defined as the middle element when n is odd and average of middle two elements when n is even.
Since the array is not sorted here, we sort the array first, then apply above formula.
